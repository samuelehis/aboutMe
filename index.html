        <p>My name is Samuel Ehis and I am a System Administrator/Technical support Specialist, a HND Graduate of Computer science but currently studying in AltSchoolAfrica</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Why I joined AltSchool </h3>
        <p>I got enrolled into altschool Africa after reading about them on the internet when searching for an online school to learn cloud engineering. I was attracted to them after listening to the testimonies from past students and I thought it was an opportunity to bring the dreams of becoming a cloud engineer to reality.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>What I am looking to Achieve</h3>
        <p>At the end of my program at AltSchoolAfrica, I want to be very conversant with deployment of applications on servers and able to manage cloud servers hosted on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure and Alibaba. </p>
